# FlashCards: A mobile App

## Project Overview
For thisÂ project, I built a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course. For this project, I used `create-react-app` as a starter template.

## How to run the application
- Download the repository in your desktop and unzip it
- Open your terminal and run `yarn install` and `yarn start`


## Platforms
This project has been tested on an Android device and on an iOS emulator.
